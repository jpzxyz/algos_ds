# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Algorithms

Algorithms are fundamental to computer science. 
Depending on who you ask, an algorithm is composed of three or four properties.

Definiteness: contains clear, concise, and unambiguous steps 
Effectiveness: Ability to perform precise operations to solve a given problem
Finiteness: The algorithm stops after a finite number of steps
Correctness: An algorithm produces the same output for a given input

### Time

__time.py__

Tracks how long the computer takes to print the given range.
Given a range of 1 to 10, this straightforward algorithm requires 10 steps to complete.
f(n) = 10
